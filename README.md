# TASK_03
This task involves writing and optimizing SQL queries to manipulate and analyze data effectively.

Use SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY: Retrieve specific columns with SELECT, filter rows using WHERE, group rows with GROUP BY to perform aggregate calculations, and sort results using ORDER BY to organize output as needed.

Use JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT): Combine rows from two or more related tables using different join types:

INNER JOIN returns matching rows from both tables,

LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right,

RIGHT JOIN returns all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left.

Write Subqueries: Create nested queries within a main query to filter, compare, or aggregate data based on results from another query, enhancing query modularity and complexity handling.

Use Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG): Apply functions like SUM() to calculate total values and AVG() to find averages over grouped data sets, often combined with GROUP BY for meaningful summaries.

Create Views for Analysis: Define virtual tables using CREATE VIEW that encapsulate complex queries for repeated use, presenting data as if from a single table while always reflecting up-to-date underlying data.

Optimize Queries with Indexes: Improve query performance by creating indexes on frequently searched columns, enabling faster data retrieval by minimizing full table scans. Choose appropriate index types and avoid over-indexing to balance read and write efficiency
